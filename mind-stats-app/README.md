🧠 MIND: Statistics Visualizer Suite
Created by Professor Edward Pineda-Castro at Los Angeles City College, this interactive Streamlit app helps students explore core statistics concepts using visuals, interactive tools, and hands-on simulations.

🚀 Tools Included
Descriptive Statistics Tool

Generate frequency and relative frequency tables

Create bar charts, pie charts, and histograms

View summary statistics (mean, median, mode, std deviation)

✅ Challenge: Interpret which category has the highest frequency and explain its impact on central tendency.

Probability Explorer (coming soon)

Visualize probability experiments and outcomes

Simulate coin tosses, dice rolls, and events

✅ Challenge: Calculate 
𝑃
(
𝐴
 or 
𝐵
)
P(A or B) from a two-way table.

Discrete Distributions Visualizer (coming soon)

Explore binomial and Poisson distributions

Plot PMFs and cumulative probabilities

✅ Challenge: Find the probability of exactly 
𝑘
k successes in a binomial trial.

Continuous Distributions Visualizer (coming soon)

Visualize Normal, Exponential, and Uniform distributions

Compute and shade areas under the curve

✅ Challenge: Determine probabilities for intervals using the standard normal table.

Confidence Interval Builder (coming soon)

Construct confidence intervals for means and proportions

Interactive sliders for confidence level and sample size

✅ Challenge: Interpret a 95% CI and explain its meaning in context.

Hypothesis Testing Modules (coming soon)

One-sample and two-sample tests (z, t-tests)

Chi-Square and ANOVA testing

Visual rejection regions with critical values

✅ Challenge: Decide whether to reject 
𝐻
0
H 
0
​
  based on 
𝑝
p-value.

Regression and Correlation Explorer (coming soon)

Fit linear regression models

Visualize correlation strength and direction

✅ Challenge: Interpret slope and 
𝑅
2
R 
2
  in a regression model.
