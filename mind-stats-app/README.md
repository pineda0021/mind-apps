# 📊 MIND: Statistics Visualizer Suite

Created by **Professor Edward Pineda-Castro** at Los Angeles City College, this interactive Streamlit app helps students explore core statistics concepts using visuals, simulations, and hands-on data analysis tools.

## 🚀 Tools Included

1. **Descriptive Statistics Tool**
   - Create frequency and relative frequency tables
   - Generate bar charts, pie charts, and histograms
   - Handle qualitative, discrete quantitative, and continuous data
   - ✅ *Challenge*: Build a grouped frequency table and interpret relative frequencies.

2. **Probability Explorer** *(coming soon)*
   - Visualize basic probability concepts
   - Interactive tree diagrams and Venn diagrams
   - ✅ *Challenge*: Solve compound probability problems using diagrams.

3. **Discrete Distributions Tool** *(coming soon)*
   - Explore Binomial, Poisson, and other discrete distributions
   - Plot probability mass functions (PMFs)
   - ✅ *Challenge*: Compute probabilities for given discrete random variables.

4. **Continuous Distributions Tool** *(coming soon)*
   - Visualize normal, exponential, and other continuous distributions
   - Calculate areas under the curve
   - ✅ *Challenge*: Find probabilities and percentiles for continuous data.

5. **Confidence Interval Builder** *(coming soon)*
   - Construct confidence intervals for means and proportions
   - Visualize sampling distributions
   - ✅ *Challenge*: Interpret confidence levels for real-world datasets.

6. **Hypothesis Testing Tools** *(coming soon)*
   - Perform one-sample and two-sample hypothesis tests
   - Visual representation of rejection regions
   - ✅ *Challenge*: Decide whether to reject \(H_0\) based on test statistics and p-values.

7. **Chi-Square and ANOVA Analyzer** *(coming soon)*
   - Conduct Chi-square tests and ANOVA for categorical and multi-group comparisons
   - ✅ *Challenge*: Interpret results and significance levels.

8. **Regression Analysis Explorer** *(coming soon)*
   - Visualize linear regression with real-time plots
   - Display slope, intercept, and correlation coefficient
   - ✅ *Challenge*: Predict outcomes and evaluate model fit.
