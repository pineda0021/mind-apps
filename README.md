ðŸ§  MIND: Calculus Visualizer Suite

Created by Professor Edward Pineda-Castro. Mathematics Department at Los Angeles City College, this interactive Streamlit app helps students explore core calculus concepts using visuals, animations, and symbolic math.

ðŸš€ Tools Included

Limits Visualizer

Explore removable and non-removable discontinuities

See animations of functions approaching a limit

Tabular values with undefined points

âœ… Challenge: Determine the limit as  from a table and animation.

Derivative Visualizer

Plot a function and its derivative

See symbolic differentiation (via SymPy)

âœ… Challenge: Match a function to its derivative graph or compute  at a point.

Riemann Sum Explorer

Compare Left, Right, Midpoint, Trapezoidal, and Upper/Lower Sums

Overlay rectangles on graphs

Compute absolute and relative error

âœ… Challenge: Estimate area using Midpoint sum and compare to the exact integral.

Antiderivative (Integral) Visualizer

See the function and its integral side-by-side

Symbolic antiderivatives displayed with +C

âœ… Challenge: Identify antiderivatives from multiple choices.

Solid of Revolution Tool

Compute volume using Disk/Washer or Shell method

3D plotly visualization for revolution around the x or y-axis

Step-by-step integral setup and solution in exact form

âœ… Challenge: Match volume expressions to the correct setup for a region.
